# The Styling Works
This is the front end codebase for the *The Styling Works* website. It uses a static site generator called [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) to build a standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript site. 

Essentially, when the build command is triggered (either by a change to the siteâ€™s code or content) Gatsby fetches the content from the back end, mixes it with the files in the `src` directory and churns out a website. See the [GatsbyJS documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) for more details.
